//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let newArr = ['movieA', 'movieB', 'movieC']
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let newVar = newArr[0]
console.log(newVar)
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let newArrLength = newArr.length
console.log(newArrLength)
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastElement = newArr[newArr.length - 1]
